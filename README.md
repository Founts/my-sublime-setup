My Sublime Setup
================

This is a Sublime Text 2 setup project. For those that move from machine to machine, or plan for the worst, this is for you.

Idea
The idea here is that you fine tune your editor setup and you are productive with that setup. When something happens to your magical text editor configuration and you want to restore it, or you move to a new computer, this projects helps you out. Also, if you map out why you use certain packages and settings and you want to move to something like say atom.io, you can do this easier.

Files
This repo currently has Sublime Text packages and preferences files.

TODO create a script which copies the files to the appropriate location in the sublime directory.
